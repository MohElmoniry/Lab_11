Looks like your services are being called upon once more to decode some encrypted messages that the Garda think might be useful as part of one of their ongoing investigations. They have intercepted what they believe to be an encrypted message, sent out from the suspects machine just before they managed to seize the computer. 

Some of the files etc. have been slightly damaged or lost, but the forensics team have partially recovered the code they believe was used to encrypt the message in question. Unfortunately, it looks like it’s some type of encryption (which always scares forensic people) so they’ve given you a call to see if you can help. Can you help the Garda and decrypt the intercepted message? 

Some potentially useful information: 

• The Garda have provided you with a copy of the code they believe was used to encrypt the message and also a copy of the intercepted message. 

• The program used looks like it’s written in python. So, you’ll have to figure out what the code is doing before trying to figure out how to decode the output. 

• Some of the original program code was damaged so you are missing a few bits or original code, that you have to try fix or guess. 

• From kali you can run the python code from the command line by entering the command “python encryptme.py” 

• The Garda are only concerned with getting the decoded message and they don’t really care how you do it… write your own code or do it by hand, or whatever other methods you like
